Welcome to **The Blueprint**, the heart of this entire platform. This is where your journey _officially_ begins.

Before jumping into hands-on projects or advanced topics, this section is designed to help you **understand the foundations** of both **DevSecOps** and **Cloud Security Development.**

## Overview

The Blueprint is divided into two major sections that build on each other:

| **Section**                                                                      | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**Soft Skills**](./soft-skills)                                                 | Learn how to effectively work with people, talk to them, and understand the importance of teamwork and effective communication.                                                                                                   |
| [**DevSecOps**](./devsecops/devsecops-fundamentals)                              | Learn the fundamentals of integrating security within the software development lifecycle (SDLC). You’ll explore topics like application security, CI/CD, SAST/DAST testing, and the principles of shifting security left.         |
| [**Cloud Security Development**](./cloud_security_development/cloud-foundations) | Learn how to build and secure applications _within_ the cloud. You’ll explore identity and access management (IAM), secrets management, logging and events, APIs, serverless automation, and secure Infrastructure as Code (IaC). |

Together, these two areas make up the core learning foundation for anyone looking to grow into a modern cloud security or DevSecOps role.

## Why The Blueprint Exists

There’s a lot of noise out there when it comes to DevSecOps and Cloud Security tools, frameworks, certifications, acronyms… the list goes on. This Blueprint cuts through that noise, and focuses on what actually matters:

- Understanding the **core principles** first.
- Learning **how** and **why** security fits into development.
- Building a foundation that makes every future project easier to understand.

Think of this as your on-ramp into everything else that follows, or rather the theory before the practice.

## How to Navigate

If you’re new here, start from the top:

1. **Begin with DevSecOps**: Learn the mindset, the process, and how security fits into development.
2. **Then move into Cloud Security Development**: Learn how those same principles apply in cloud environments.
3. **Apply what you learn in Projects**: Get hands-on experience building pipelines, automation, and cloud-native security tools.

Each page builds on the last, introducing concepts gradually and with real-world examples to make learning easier and practical.

## Who This Is For

This section is for:

- Developers who want to write secure code.
- Security engineers learning how to automate in CI/CD.
- Cloud engineers who want to understand secure design principles.
- Anyone exploring DevSecOps or Cloud Security as a career path.

## What You’ll Gain

By the end of this section, you’ll be able to:

- Explain how DevSecOps integrates security into modern software development.
- Understand how cloud environments are structured and secured.
- Recognize key concepts like IAM, Secrets, Logging, and IaC.
- Build a mental model for secure development prior to touching a single tool.

## The Big Picture

**The Blueprint** is the foundation that ties everything together:

- The **Soft Skills** explains why you need to know how to talk and work with people.
- The **DevSecOps section** shows you _how to integrate security._
- The **Cloud Security Development section** shows you _how to build securely._
- The **Projects section** lets you _put it all into practice._

Every part of this learning journey connects back to this. Why you may ask? Because security isn’t a single tool or step. It’s a mindset, a process, and a way of building.
