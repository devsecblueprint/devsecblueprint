## Overview

Before wiring up your pipeline, youâ€™ll need an Azure DevOps organization and a Personal Access Token (PAT). This section walks you through creating your DevOps organization, setting its visibility, and generating a PAT that will be used later in your pipeline configuration.

## Creating an Azure DevOps Organization

1. While logged into the **Azure Portal**, open a new tab and go to [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com).

   - Fill out the form with your details and click **Continue**.
   - Make sure to set the **Visibility** to **Private**.

2. Once complete, navigate back to the Azure DevOps homepage.

   - Click **New organization** and choose a unique name (example: `devsecblueprint`).
