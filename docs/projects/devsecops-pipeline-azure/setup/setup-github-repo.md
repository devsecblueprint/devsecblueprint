## Overview

Your pipeline relies on GitHub repositories to host both the application code and the infrastructure definitions. In this section, youâ€™ll fork the required repositories into your personal GitHub account so you can make changes, push updates, and run the pipeline independently.

If youâ€™re new to GitHub, itâ€™s a web-based platform built on top of Git (a distributed version control system). It allows developers to manage code, track changes, collaborate, and contribute from anywhere in the world. For a quick primer, check out this [Introduction to GitHub](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-github/) article.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure you have a **GitHub account**.

- If you donâ€™t already have one, follow this [guide to create a GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github).

## Configuration Steps

### Forking Repositories

1. Log in to your **GitHub account**.

2. Navigate to the first project:
   [Azure DevSecOps Infrastructure](https://github.com/devsecblueprint/azure-devsecops-pipeline)

3. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner.

4. Select your personal account as the **Owner** and click **Create Fork**.

   - Make sure the option **Copy the main branch only** is enabled.

5. Repeat the same steps for the second project:

   [Azure FastAPI](https://github.com/devsecblueprint/azure-python-fastapi)

6. Once forked, clone both repositories to your local machine. For example:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/azure-python-fastapi
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/azure-devsecops-pipeline
   ```

## Conclusion

Thatâ€™s it! ðŸŽ‰ You now have your own copies of the **infrastructure** and **application** repositories inside your GitHub account. With these set up, youâ€™re ready to configure secrets and wire up your DevSecOps pipeline in the next steps.
